ZED is a fork of TED that adds Zilog Z80 assembly syntax highlighting to TED.
TED is a clone of the editor of the same name that once was available for the
DEC's RT-11 OS.

Open TED.INC in a text editor and check that HILI is set to TRUE.

Then, set HILIAR to TRUE or FALSE depending on system performance.
[0m[1m-[22m TRUE if automatic refresh of syntax highlighting
[0m[1m-[22m FALSE if manual refresh of screen and the syntax highlighting

Submit the MKZED.SUB file, let M80 assemble and let L80 link to get ZED.COM.

; A comment like this is displayed in low intensity (faint).
"A string like this is displayed in italics".
'A string like this is also displayed in italics'.
Zilog Z80 mnemonics are displayed in high intensity (boldface):
	add
	and
	call
	pop
	push
	ret
	xor

Mnemonics are case insensitive so these are also displayed in boldface:
	BIT
	DI
	EI
	RST
	SET


[7m[4m[1m ZED performance
[0m
The syntax highlighting in ZED slightly reduces performance compared to TED.
My tests with ZED in the YAZE-AG Z80 emulator shows that ZED can be used even
if the Z80 CPU frequency is set as low as 4 MHz.
